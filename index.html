                <h1>PROFILE</h1>
                <p>The Integrated Research and Training Center (IRTC) is a JICA established center under the care of the Technological University of the Philippines. IRTC provides updating training and meaningful research results towards the continuous development of engineering programs and practices. The Center is housed in a five-storey building located inside the Manila Campus of TUP at Ayala Boulevard corner San Marcelino Street at the heart of the City of Manila. The Center provides facilities in the following areas: material engineering and testing, energy engineering, automation, communications, educational multimedia technology, manufacturing and production engineering. IRTC is the research, training and extension arm of the Technological University of the Philippines. It also provides valuable services to industries and higher education institutions, primarily to the state universities and colleges</p>

            <h1>ESTABLISHMENT AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT</h1>
            <p>The Integrated Research and Training Center was established in 1982 with a grant under a bilateral agreement between the governments of the Philippines and Japan. The grant included the construction of a five-storey building, core pieces of training equipment, and users’ training. The grant-aid was immediately followed by a 5-year technical cooperation that terminated in 1988 and included the installation of more sophisticated equipment and resources, trainers’ training (local and foreign), program (in training and research) development and instructional materials development. The Center was able to sustain, even expand, its operation between 1989 and 1991 at which time an after-care program was provided by JICA in order to repair or replace equipment and machines. The Center thrives in the face of a fast changing global order. In the initial decade of the new century, IRTC continuously seeks opportunities to provide quality services in education, training and research, not only to its internal clients at TUP, but also to its beneficiaries in the wider national community. Strong institutional cooperation is maintained with local partners such as DOST, DOE, DPWH-BRS, DTI-PBS, PASUC, PCA, Petron Corporation, DLSU, UP, etc. and foreign partners such as Nihon University, Arizona State University, and Tokyo Institute of Technology.</p>
